image::images/demo.png[]

Since Version 7.0 is possible to use *https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/blob/release/7.0/CHANGELOG.md#extensibility-framework[Extensibility framework]*
Magento provides different apis but currently is not possible to replace already existing components.
This repository shows a *workaround* to build a standlone PWA Studio Extension.

.Requirements
[NOTE]
We need way how a plugin can register own new components to already existing or extension provider need to many stepes before they can use extension
what will overwrite replacing an existing component.

.Vision
[NOTE]
PWA Studio packages should be able to declare which of their components are safe to replace, and make them replaceable

CAUTION: Replacing a component can be dangerous.It is not a compound change, so if two extensions both want to replace the same file, it can lead to errors.
